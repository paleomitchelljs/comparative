# Migration state — read this first

**What is done, what is next, and what is blocked.** The plan is in
[`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md); file trust is in [`FILE-LEDGER.md`](FILE-LEDGER.md).

**Update this file in the same commit as the work.** Its only value is being
current.

---

## Next action

> **Task 2 — build the scaffold generator and prove the round trip is lossless.**
> Task 1 is done: the extraction key is (species, source, name, region) and
> `validate.py` errors if it ever resolves to two records. The re-mine (Task 4)
> can start on any source at any time and is the long pole.

## Task board

| # | Task | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `region` on occurrence names; kill the 25 ambiguous keys | **done** |
| 2 | Scaffold generator + lossless round-trip proof | not started |
| 3 | `after:` field for secondary attribution | not started |
| 4 | Re-mine every cited source | **in progress — 2 of 79** |
| 5 | Flip source of truth to `observations/` + `mapping/` | not started |
| 6 | Retire `attribute_species.py` and friends | not started |
| 7 | `phylogeny.json` | not started |

## Re-mine progress

<!-- counts:remine -->
| Status | Sources | Rows they carry |
|---|---:|---:|
| `remined` | 2 | 63 |
| `not-started` | 73 | 1868 |
| `blocked-no-source` | 4 | 80 |
| **total** | **79** | **2011** |

**2 of 79 cited sources re-mined** (2%).
<!-- /counts:remine -->

### What counts as done

A source is `remined` only when **every muscle it describes is either filed or
parked**, and the note states the arithmetic. Two sources have cleared that bar:

- **Fisher & Goodman (1955)** — 111 muscles with an origin paragraph: 43 filed,
  50 parked, the rest inside multi-muscle rows. Moved the Aves column further than
  any single pass so far; the figures are in `STATUS.md`.
- **Widrig et al. (2026)** — 38 blocks: 20 filed, 16 parked, 2 folded into
  existing rows.

### Sources that cannot be re-mined

<!-- counts:remine-blocked -->
| Source | Rows |
|---|---:|
| `walthall-ashley-ross-2006` | 63 |
| `pereyra-etal-2024` | 11 |
| `fritzsch-2023` | 3 |
| `navarro-etal-2023` | 3 |

**4 sources, 80 rows** that cannot be verified against a paper.
<!-- /counts:remine-blocked -->

These carry rows nobody can currently check against a paper. **Do not quietly
trust them** — they are the same class of claim the audit found wanting elsewhere,
minus the ability to test them.

**Four of the original eight were acquired on 2026-08-19** and are now
`not-started` rather than blocked: Cunningham (the whole Challenger part XVI, from
archive.org), Sefton et al. (eLife, gold OA), the Diogo et al. supplementary (gold
OA, and it is a `.docx`), and the Gest tables (eight region pages mirrored to
`papers/gest-anatomy-tables/`). That moved 419 of the 458 unverifiable rows back
into reach.

The four that remain are not paywalled in the ordinary sense, and none should be
worked around:

| Source | Why | How to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `walthall-ashley-ross-2006` | Bronze OA — free to read on Wiley, no open licence. Wiley serves a bot-check page to scripts | Browser |
| `pereyra-etal-2024` | In PMC but **not** in the PMC open-access subset, so there is no programmatic route | Browser |
| `fritzsch-2023` | Open on Preprints.org; the download endpoint blocks scripted requests | Browser |
| `navarro-etal-2023` | **Genuinely closed access** | Subscription or author copy |

Drop them in `papers/` under the filename the reading note already implies, add the
`pdf` field to `sources.json`, and set the status to `not-started`.

## Known-incomplete sources with a local copy

The audit of 2026-08-19 examined four and found drops in all four. Their reading
notes carry the detail; each is `not-started` until re-mined.

| Source | Held | Also contains |
|---|---|---|
| Russell & Bauer (2008) | 71 rows, 70 on *Iguana* | 558 statements across 22 lepidosaur genera. Mostly **secondary** — needs Task 3 |
| Walker (1973) | 22 rows, all *Trachemys* | 90 statements across 9 other turtle genera, **first-hand**. Best target |
| Osawa (1898) | 63 rows, all limb | The whole cranial and axial myology |
| Burch (2014) | 38 rows, all *Tawa* | A bracket table of 35 extant taxa, 7 already species here |

## Decisions taken, so they are not relitigated

- **Extraction is keyed on (species × study), not on homology group.** 2026-08-19.
- **Everything must be re-mined**, not migrated forward. The audit found drops in
  4 of 4 sources, so current rows are a partial extraction throughout.
- **The mapping is per source.** A global name table would destroy the
  disagreements the dataset exists to hold.
- **The key is (name, region), not name.** 25 collisions proved it.
- **Serial correspondence sources do not set `homology.authority`.** 2026-08-19.
- **Element correspondences exist** for "may be one element, undemonstrated".

## Open questions

- Ergonomics of 220 files at a median of 4 muscles, 58 of them singletons. Live
  with it, or group small studies?
- Cross-taxon review — seeing every animal's latissimus at once — becomes generated
  rather than authored. That is the one thing the current model does better, and
  the generated view has to be good enough to review from.
